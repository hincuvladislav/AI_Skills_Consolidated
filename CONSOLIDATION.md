# Consolidation log

Units kept: **334** · decisions below. Rules: R1 byte-identical dedup · R2 stale/expanded forks dropped in favor of the original author's current version · R3 same-name different-skill kept in separate categories · R4 composite units kept intact (sub-skill name overlap is not a conflict).

Input ids (s1..s4, local) are resolved in `MAINTAINERS.md` (maintainers-only provenance file). One input's `deprecated/`, `in-progress/`, `personal/` dirs are excluded by policy.
